You're having coffee/tea/beverage of your choice with a friend that is learning to program in
Python. They're curious about why they would use pip.

Explain what pip is and one benefit of using pip.

Pip is a package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional libraries
and dependencies that are not included in the standard Python library. Essentially, pip makes it easy
to add third-party modules to your Python environment, enabling you to leverage a vast ecosystem of
pre-built tools and solutions.

One key benefit of using pip is that it simplifies the process of installing and updating packages.
Instead of manually downloading libraries, unzipping them, and setting up paths, you can simply use a
command like `pip install package-name`. This command will automatically handle the downloading,
installing, and setting up of the package for you. Additionally, pip can manage package versions,
helping you to ensure compatibility and maintain a stable environment for your projects. This
convenience and efficiency can save a lot of time and reduce potential errors, especially as your
projects grow in complexity.
