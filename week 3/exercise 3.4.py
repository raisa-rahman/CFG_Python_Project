#Exercise 3.4: Now that you've nished your burger, you want to pay for your food. Let's write a
#program to calculate your meal and apply a discount if applicable.
#If your total meal costs more than Â£20 and you have a discount, the price will be reduced by 10%.
#The program should print "Discount applied" or "No discount" depending on whether the discount
#criteria was met.

#meal_price = float(input('How much did the meal cost? '))
#discount_choice = input('Do you have a discount? y/n ')
#discount_applicable = discount_choice == 'y'
