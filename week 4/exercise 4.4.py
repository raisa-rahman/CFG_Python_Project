#Exercise 4.4: I want to work out how much money I've spent on lunch this week. I've created a list
# of what I spent each day.

# Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the total cost

costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
total_cost = 0

total = sum(costs)

for costs in costs:
    total_cost = total_cost + costs


print(total_cost)
print(total)
