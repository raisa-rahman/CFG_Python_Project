#Exercise 4.3: Whenever I'm shopping and I buy some bread I always forget to buy butter.
# Create a list and if 'bread' is in the list, add 'butter' to the shopping list.

#Try running the program with and without bread in the list to check that your program works.

#Remember the in operator checks if an item is in a list and the .append() method adds an item to a list.

shopping_list = [
    'bread'
]

if 'bread' in shopping_list:
    shopping_list.append('butter')

print(shopping_list)
