'''I have a list of things I need to buy from my supermarket of choice.

shopping_list = [
"oranges",
"cat food",
"sponge cake",
"long-grain rice",
"cheese board",
]
print(shopping_list[1])

I want to know what the first thing I need to buy is. However, when I run the program it shows me a
different answer to what I was expecting? What is the mistake? How do I fix it?'''

shopping_list = [
    "oranges",
    "cat food",
    "sponge cake",
    "long-grain rice",
    "cheese board",
]
print(shopping_list[0])

#the mistake is that arrays start at 0, so i changed the 1 to 0
